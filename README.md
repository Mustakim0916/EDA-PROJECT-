📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
<br>
🧠 Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, relationships, and hidden insights within the dataset.
The main goal is to clean, visualize, and interpret data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

EDA helps uncover:

Patterns and relationships between features

Missing values and data inconsistencies

Outliers or unusual observations

Key insights for better decision-making or model preparation

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas → Data manipulation and cleaning

NumPy → Numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn → Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Interactive analysis environment

🔍 Key Steps in Analysis

Data Loading and Inspection

Imported the dataset and explored its structure using head(), info(), and describe().

Data Cleaning

Handled missing or null values using dropna() and fillna().

Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistent data formats.

Data Transformation

Converted data types, created new columns, and encoded categorical variables if required.

Exploratory Visualization

Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots.

Explored relationships with pair plots, heatmaps, and correlation analysis.

Insights and Observations

Identified trends, correlations, and outliers.

Highlighted key takeaways and business implications.

📈 Types of Analysis Performed

Univariate Analysis → Understanding single-column distributions

Bivariate Analysis → Relationship between two variables

Multivariate Analysis → Interaction among multiple features

Correlation Analysis → Checking how features are interrelated

Outlier Detection → Identifying anomalies in data

💡 Key Insights

(You can customize this section once you see your actual results)

Certain columns show strong positive correlation.

Few missing values were found and imputed using mean/median.

Outliers identified and handled to make data more stable.

Distribution of categorical data is uneven — useful for feature engineering later.

🧾 Learning Outcomes

Improved understanding of dataset structure and statistics

Strengthened data visualization and interpretation skills

Prepared dataset for machine learning or business analysis

Practiced storytelling through data

🚀 Future Scope

Feature engineering for model preparation

Predictive modeling using ML algorithms

Dashboard creation using Power BI or Tableau
